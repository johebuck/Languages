To run: java Dijkstra.graph <graph> <start> <end> where graph is any file with an adjacency list with 2 nodes and a weight
        start is source and end is destination for finding shortest path.
       
        Graph provided is dijkstra.graph which implements graph used in previous assignments
        
Currently prints the original graph, the source node and destination node, almost finished finding shortest path.
